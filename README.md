# Snippets

_Snippets is a repository that stores snippets from languages I want to work on, as well as some theories / thoughts that I have on the same topic._

## What does this repository contain?

It contains concepts and features, in programming languages (that I use), with which I sometimes get confused.

## What languages are you interested in working on?

I'm only interested in Python, and Modern C++/C/CUDA. [Any performant system comes down to algorithms and engineering](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4911818), and programming languages is just a small part of engineering (e.g. less than architecture design). These are more than enough to cover my use cases (I do not build too much frontend).

Personally, I treat all other languages as domain specific and use them from time to time, but those aren't my focus. **Languages are the same anyways, so they can be picked up easily**.

## Resources for learning those languages?

See the concepts for [Python](./python/README.md), [Modern C++](./cxx/README.md)

## Thoughts on languages?

My thoughts on languages exist in the [mind repo](https://github.com/rentruewang/mind)
